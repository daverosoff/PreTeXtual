Release notes for 0.7.1:

    * `@name` on `<var>` tag now can contain a Perl variable with correct
      highlighting. Thanks to Alex Jordan for the bug fix request.

    * Fixed a syntax bug that led to anything inside `<idx>...</idx>` not
      being highlighted and `<idx>` and `<h>` not closing correctly. Thanks to
      @j-oldroyd for spotting the error.

    * Go To Symbol and Go To Symbol in Project should work a little better
      now. You still have to set the root file for each project to use Go To
      Symbol in Project.

Release notes for 0.7.0-rc.3:

    * `<p>` tags were not autoclosing properly. This is fixed now. Thanks
      to Alex Jordan for spotting the problem.

Release notes for 0.7.0-rc.2:

    * This is a cosmetic release that was necessary due to developer error.
      The code is identical to 0.7.0-rc.

Release notes for 0.7.0-rc:

    * The symbol navigation (Go To Symbol/Go To Symbol In Project) has been
      fixed and should be much more usable now. Use Ctrl-R or Ctrl-Shift-R to
      try it. (Fixed from 0.5.0)
    * Syntax definition updated to reflect major changes in PreTeXt over the
      past months. (Fixed from 0.5.0)
    * <h>, etc., tags within <idx> are not properly highlighted (but no
      longer appear spuriously in symbol navigation)
    * Snippets improved, rationalized, and expanded. (Fixed from 0.6.0)
    * Build system no longer relies on Vagrant and can be used with a
      traditional installation (possibly on any OS?). User will need to
      configure paths manually.
    * Many parts of the UI have been updated or rationalized. Some shortcuts
      may have changed.

Known issues:
    * Go To Symbol In Project (Ctrl-Shift-R) seems to only operate on open
      files, not necessarily all files in project
    * Build system paths are not always stored correctly
    * Ref autocompletion is broken

Known issues from 0.5.0 not fixed in this release:

    * The scoping for embedded syntaxes is not completely satisfactory

Known issues from 0.4.5 not fixed in this release:

    * Mirroring title text to get xml:id is good for divisions, but less
      good for theorems (often not titled)
    * Mirrored title text in snippet xml:id does not always give
      completely satisfactory results (e.g., XML tags inside)
        - Should there be a user setting to disable this mirroring?
        - Is this even possible?
    * Typing '<xref ref=""' results in a spurious error ("ref/cite:
      unrecognized format")
    * Potential for confusion since Symbols List is always based on
      the current project (or open folder) but the ref autocomplete
      list may not be (if there is not an explicit project and the
      root PreTeXt file is set globally or not at all)
